## Tech Stack:
We will be using React for the frontend and Flask for the backend. 

## Details: 
The web app will be in the style of a forum where users can make an account, make posts, and respond to those posts. Additionally, they may
create a profile page and view others' profiles to learn more about them. Furthermore, they will be able to delete and update their
posts to fix errors. 

## User Roles:
- Students will be able to find study groups to find help in their classes.
- Hobbyists will be able to create or join a team to work on projects.
