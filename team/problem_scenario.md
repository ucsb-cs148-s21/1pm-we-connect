# Problem Scenario
Little Timmie is a shy student looking for people to study and make a project with. However, Timmie is so shy that he doesn't know
how to make friends in real life. If only there was a convenient web app that could let him ask a large audience to connect with 
like-minded people and form a productive group. Luckily, our web app will solve all of little Timmie's problems by providing him 
with a forum styled web app where he can make a post and quickly find new people to work with.
