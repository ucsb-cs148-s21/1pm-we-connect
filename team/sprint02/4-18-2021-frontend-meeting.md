# Meeting reflection(for Thanawat)
During this meeting, Thanawat(I'll just say I from now on), attempted to "wing" teaching React because I was busy with other work and also was procrastinating. Unlike when I was teaching flask, I didn't take the time to prepare before hand and remind myself on what I forgot on React. Thus, I didn't get to cover enough during the session, and maybe even covered irrelevant stuff. I didn't take the time to think about what concepts are more important than others, so I didn't get to teach the more important concepts like what Components are, and instead taught stuff about Hooks instead. Even during teaching hooks, stuff went wrong and I wasn't prepared for it. If I were to give a rating for myself as a someone who is mentoring a new member on React, I guess I would give myself a 50%, an F. For next time, I need to get better at preparing if I need to mentor my teammates for projects. I need to not get complacent just because I have done something before doesn't mean I can do something now.
