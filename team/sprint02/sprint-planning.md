# Sprint Planning
## Backend
- Kevin and Kenneth will work together on the Flask backend and finish making the API using in-memory data storage by Sunday(See issues for more details.)
- Kevin and Kenneth will do Flask tutorials and ask for help in order to accomplish the previous task
- Once we are done with the Flask backend using in-memory data storage, we can add the SQL database, sqlite3.
## Frontend
- Alon and Surrendra will work together on the React frontend and design just one page to view and submit new projects(without any calls to the backend)
- Alon and Surrendra will watch any necessary tutorials, read any ncessary articles and ask for help in order to acomplish their task
- After they have built a page, they will then add `useState` hooks and make the necessary API calls to the backend.

## The "Thanawat" tasks: Testing, deployment, and other stuf
- Thanawat will deal with setting deployment to Heroku. He will get the help necessary if he needs it.
- He will also figure out how to test both the React part(using `react-testing-library` and `react-storybook`) and the Flask part(haven't figured out the details yet haha)
- Lastly, he will help any of the team members if they need it, review all the code that they write, and make sure that the team is functioning.
