Hello, my name is Alon Katz. I am second year computer science major. I am really looking forward to working on this project. For this project I was thinking that we would make a platform/ website that will allow people (not just students) to post about personal projects that they are working on in order to recruit people to join their projects. I want the project to start off being as simple as possible. I'd rather the project have a good base and work well with minimum features than have a lot of features that are not working well. I want this website to be universal so people of all fields will be able to use it.
