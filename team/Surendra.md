My name is Surendra. I am a second year CS major. Our web app should allow users to rank the projects they worked on, that way someone who is interested in a project can see what the enviroment of the previous projects their potential teammates worked on was like. Everyone should be able to see certain details of the project (goals, timeline, budget, members) and then either DM the team lead or contact them through email/facebook.
