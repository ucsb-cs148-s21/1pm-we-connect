# Date of Retrospective: 05/25/21

* Led by: Surendra
* Present: Thanawat, Kenneth, Kevin, Alon
* Absent: N/A

## Action item
* The problems: Would like to see more work done outside of class individually. The lecture and section meetings are not productive, too much time devoted to documenting. Professor Hollerer notes that the meetings can be used as coordination and work can be done individually. Technical deadlines are vauge and lack of technical knowledge make it easy to fall into cycle of procrastination. Pair programming difficult (different paces between pages).
* A goal: Have a more equal distribution of work. 
* A change: Have more concrete tasks assigned and deadlines.
* A measurement: How well are we metting the deadlines we set for ourselves. 

Deadlines and Assignments:
Kevin writes backend tests by Thursday. Surendra writes multiple tag search route by Thursday. About page done by Thurday. Thanwat will implement Navbar Friday.

## Retro Assessment

* No specific method was used. The discussion was guided by Professor Hollerer.
* Although there was some tension in the group and a feeling of that the workload was distributed unequally, the group was able to identify the problems and come up with some solutions to adress the problems.
* We were able to understand where everyone was coming from and why they felt things were not going according to plan and then from there we were able to come up with some actionable items.
