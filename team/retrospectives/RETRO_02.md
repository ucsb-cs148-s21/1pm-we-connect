# Date of Retrospective: 05/06/21

* Led by: Kevin
* Present: Thanawat, Kenneth, Surendra, Alon
* Absent: N/A

## Action item

* a goal: We want to start working on asking for help if we need it when we don't understand something.
* a change: We want to make our tasks (specifically the Kanban board) to be more detailed on what each person needs to do. 
* a measurement: A measurement of our success could be whether or not people are confused anymore throughout the next sprint. 

## Retro Assessment

* We used the Start/Stop/Continue method
* The meeting went well, the group decided that we need to be more concise and specific with our tasks and to ask if something is confusing.
* For the next person who is leading the retro, I would recommend prompting people for their input if the group is silent.

## Retrospective Outcome

* We have been significantly less confused as a team ever since we specified exactly what each person should do. Therefore,
we can conclude that the changes of this retrospective were successful. Moving forward, we will continue trying to improve
our communication and making sure everyone is on the same page as we move forward in development.
