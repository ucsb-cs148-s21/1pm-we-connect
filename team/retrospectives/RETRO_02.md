# Date of Retrospective: 05/06/21

* Led by: Kevin
* Present: Thanawat, Kenneth, Surendra, Alon
* Absent: N/A

## Action item

* a goal: We want to start working on asking for help if we need it when we don't understand something.
* a change: We want to make our tasks (specifically the Kanban board) to be more detailed on what each person needs to do. 
* a measurement: A measurement of our success could be whether or not people are confused anymore throughout the next sprint. 

## Retro Assessment

* We used the Start/Stop/Continue method
* The meeting went well, the group decided that we need to be more concise and specific with our tasks and to ask if something is confusing.
* For the next person who is leading the retro, I would recommend prompting people for their input if the group is silent.

## Retrospective Outcome

*
