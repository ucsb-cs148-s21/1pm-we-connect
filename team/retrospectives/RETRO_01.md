# Date of Retrospective: 04/20/21

* Led by: Alon
* Present: Thanawat, Kenneth, Surendra, Kevin
* Absent: N/A

## Action item

* a goal: Start setting weekly deadlines for our project. Start learning as we are working.
* a change: Prepare more for meetings
* a measurement: I think we will know if we improved if we get a website with some basic features up and running in the next couple of weeks.

## Retro Assessment

* We used the Start/Stop/Continue method
* The meeting went well, the group decided that we need to start setting up more concrete deadlines.
* For the next person who is leading the retro, I would recommend to first listen to everyone else's opinions and then if you still have an opinion to add, say it.

## Optional

* Record anything else you think the team might want to remember from this retro
