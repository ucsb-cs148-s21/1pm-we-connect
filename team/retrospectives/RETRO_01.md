# Date of Retrospective: 04/20/21

* Led by: Alon
* Present: Thanawat, Kenneth, Surendra, Kevin
* Absent: N/A

## Action item

* a goal: Start setting weekly deadlines for our project. Start learning as we are working.
* a change: Prepare more for meetings
* a measurement: I think we will know if we improved if we get a website with some basic features up and running in the next couple of weeks.

## Retro Assessment

* We used the Start/Stop/Continue method
* The meeting went well, the group decided that we need to start setting up more concrete deadlines.
* For the next person who is leading the retro, I would recommend to first listen to everyone else's opinions and then if you still have an opinion to add, say it.

## Retrospective Outcome

* After doing more meetings in our respective backend and frontend teams, we managed to finish the MVP with the database implemented. Therefore,
there is substantial evidence that an increase in meetings has improved our productivity.
