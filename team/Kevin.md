# Kevin.md
I'm Kevin Hoang and I'm currently a second year CS Major. 
For my ideas for this project, I imagine the user will sign up to a website of some kind, fill in some information on what they are looking for, and be connected.
Then, after they are connected to people, we can place them into smaller rooms where they can discuss and possibly voice chat to study together or work on a project.
