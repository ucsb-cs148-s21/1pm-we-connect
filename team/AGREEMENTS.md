# Agreements

- Planned absences should be reported as soon as possible.
- We should attend meetings we scheduled together on time with the exception of unforeseen circumstances.
- If someone can't finish their share of the work, they should let the team know so that it can be reassigned. 
- We should all respect each other and each individual's opinions.
- Everyone should contribute what they can to the project.
