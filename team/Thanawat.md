Hi, my name is Thanawat, and I'm a second year CS major! Some of the things I
love doing are reading, watching youtube videos, playing guitar, and sleeping.
# Ideas
## How the app will function
How I would imagine the app functioning is that there should be some way for
people to post project ideas and for people to sign up for those project ideas,
maybe even without having to sign up for accounts. We can have the project ideas
divided by perceived difficulty, skills involved, related major, etc, to make it
easier for people to find projects. When signing up for projects, maybe people
could give an informal resume or brief description of themselves, in case a
project is very popular and there are lots of people signing up, so the project
leader can better decide on who to pick. After this process is done, people can
share their contact information and communicate that way.
## Name for the app
Honestly, I don't like WeConnect as a name, as it sounds pretty generic and
sounds a lot like WeChat. I'm hoping that(in the later stages possibly) we can
come up with a better name for this idea.
